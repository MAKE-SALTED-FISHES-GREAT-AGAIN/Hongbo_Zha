## Self Characterizing
I spent beautiful and trouble-free years in the UK respected colleges, and studied in an interdisciplinary way.   
✔️	 Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Liverpool      
✔️	 Master of Business from Warwick Business School    

After postgraduation, I become a strategy analyst at Bytedance, while the focal work is not about desk research.    
✔️	 Product design and management     
✔️	 Data analysis

## Code Warehouse
What I store are `python scripts` of which original scenes are `spidering`, `text analysis`, `excel processing`
