## A non resume-like self-characterizing 
 <br/> 
I experienced unforgettable days in the UK respected colleges, dumb and trouble-free. I studied in an interdisciplinary way.

:white_check_mark:BSc Computer Science from the University of Liverpool


:white_check_mark:MSc Business from Warwick Business School

<br/>   

After postgraduation, I was named as a strategy analyst at Bytedance. However, the job is not in the traditional type.

:white_check_mark:Product management and data analysis are focal, rather than desk research


## A non company-owned code warehouse
 <br/> 
What I store here, are compatible plugins which:

-   are extracted from work codes, of which origins include `spidering`, `text analysis`, `excel processing`
-   are written by `python`, which language is frequently being used in Bytedance.
