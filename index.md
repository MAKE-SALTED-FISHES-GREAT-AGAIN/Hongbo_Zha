## Self Characterizing
😁 Spent beautiful and trouble-free years in the UK respected colleges, Liverpool and Warwick.

🎓 Studied in an interdisciplinary way, the major one is computer science, the minor one is business studies.   

💼 Become a strategy consultant at Bytedance after graduation, while the main work is not like consulting firms: product management and data analysis are focal, rather than desk research and slide drawing.

## Code Warehouse
📌 What I store are `python scripts` of which original scenes are `web spidering`, `text analysis`, `excel processing`
