## Self Characterizing
I spent beautiful and trouble-free years in the UK respected colleges, studied in an interdisciplinary way.   
✅ BSc Computer Science from the University of Liverpool\
✅ MSc Business from Warwick Business School    

After postgraduation, I was named as a strategy analyst at Bytedance, while the job is not in the traditional type.    
✅ Product management and data analysis are focal, rather than desk research
## Code Warehouse
What I store here, are compatible plugins which:       
-   are extracted from work codes, of which origins include `spidering`, `text analysis`, `excel processing`
-   are written by `python`, which language is frequently being used in Bytedance.
