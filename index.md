## Self Characterizing 
 <br/> 
I spent beautiful and trouble-free years in the UK respected colleges, studied in an interdisciplinary way.

   
- [x] BSc Computer Science from the University of Liverpool
- [x] MSc Business from Warwick Business School

<br/>   

After postgraduation, I was named as a strategy analyst at Bytedance, while the job is not in the traditional type.

- [x] Product management and data analysis are focal, rather than desk research


## Code Warehouse
 <br/> 
What I store here, are compatible plugins which:

-   are extracted from work codes, of which origins include `spidering`, `text analysis`, `excel processing`
-   are written by `python`, which language is frequently being used in Bytedance.
